# DOSBlood
DOSBlood is a fork of the [Blood (1997) source code reconstruction by nukeykt](https://github.com/nukeykt/Blood-RE).

It adds faster mouse input response, fixes save difficulty bug and other memory issues - nothing extra.

Watcom 10.6 and TASM 3.2 are required to build.

## Build instructions
1) Build helix32 and qtools (e.g. `cd helix32` and then `wmake`)
2) Build blood (e.g. `cd blood` and then `wmake`)
